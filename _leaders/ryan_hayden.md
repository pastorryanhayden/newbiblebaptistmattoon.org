Ryan Hayden has served as pastor at Bible Baptist since November 2011. Prior to coming to Bible Baptist, Ryan served as a Christian school teacher, assistant pastor, and camp director at Fairview Baptist ministries in Athens, TN. Ryan is a graduate of Crown College, in Knoxville, TN and has been working towards a master degree from Pensacola Christian College. Ryan grew up in New Hampshire and northeast Virginia.

Pastor Hayden enjoys preaching expository messages and taking a hands on approach to children's ministry. He publishes a regular podcast called "The Foolishness of Preaching" where he interviews a pastor or preacher about their preaching. He often says his greatest privilege (besides his own family) is getting to serve the people at Bible Baptist.

Pastor Hayden is joined in the ministry by his wife Amanda and three children: Audrey (7), Molly (5) and Noah (3).

When not ministering, Pastor Hayden enjoys reading, blogging, cooking pizza in his outdoor pizza oven, designing websites and spending time with his family.
